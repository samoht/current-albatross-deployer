synopsis: """
An ocurrent plugin to deploy MirageOS unikernels
"""
description: """
This is an [ocurrent](https://github.com/ocurrent/ocurrent) plugin to manage deployment of
unikernels. It's specialized for linux, using [Albatross](https://github.com/roburio/albatross)
for orchestrating the virtual machines and `iptables` for exposing ports.

It's been made with _zero downtime_ in mind, meaning that when an unikernel is updated, a new
instance is started while keeping the old one alive, and the switch to the new instance is managed
using a port redirection to the new IP.
